### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Resposive design
- Vanilla JS
- CSS

### What I learned

Input validations; Good overall training/exercise with JS;

### Continued development

- Keep upgrading the JS code for less DRY principle;
- Html form, label, button elements (MDN docs deepdive);
- When entering character in custom %number and then clicking on any %btn - error msg stays;
